# Machine Learning Algorithms
This project aims to study Machine Learning algorithms, through the [Machine Learning e Data Science com Python de A a Z](https://www.udemy.com/course/machine-learning-e-data-science-com-python-y/) course

The implemented algorithms are:

### Classification
- [Artificial neural networks](https://github.com/ronaldogomes96/MachineLearningCourse/tree/master/Classification/Artificial%20neural%20networks)
- [Decision trees](https://github.com/ronaldogomes96/MachineLearningCourse/tree/master/Classification/Decision%20trees)
- [Instance-based learning](https://github.com/ronaldogomes96/MachineLearningCourse/tree/master/Classification/Instance-based%20learning)
- [Learning by rules](https://github.com/ronaldogomes96/MachineLearningCourse/tree/master/Classification/Learning%20by%20rules)
- [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/ronaldogomes96/MachineLearningCourse/tree/master/Classification/Logistic%20Regression)
- [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/ronaldogomes96/MachineLearningCourse/tree/master/Classification/Naive%20Bayes)
- [Support Vector Machines (SVM)](https://github.com/ronaldogomes96/MachineLearningCourse/tree/master/Classification/Support%20Vector%20Machines%20(SVM))

### Regression
- [Decision trees Regression](https://github.com/ronaldogomes96/MachineLearningCourse/tree/master/Regression/Decision%20trees)
- [Linear Regression](https://github.com/ronaldogomes96/MachineLearningCourse/tree/master/Regression/Linear%20Regression)
- [Neural networks Regression](https://github.com/ronaldogomes96/MachineLearningCourse/tree/master/Regression/Neural%20networks)
- [Polynomial Regression](https://github.com/ronaldogomes96/MachineLearningCourse/tree/master/Regression/Polynomial%20Regression)
- [Support Vectors Regression](https://github.com/ronaldogomes96/MachineLearningCourse/tree/master/Regression/Support%20Vectors)

### Clustering
- [K-means](https://github.com/ronaldogomes96/MachineLearningCourse/tree/master/Clustering/%20K-means)
- [Association Rules](https://github.com/ronaldogomes96/MachineLearningCourse/tree/master/Clustering/Association%20Rules)
- [DBSCAN](https://github.com/ronaldogomes96/MachineLearningCourse/tree/master/Clustering/DBSCAN)
- [Hierarchical grouping](https://github.com/ronaldogomes96/MachineLearningCourse/tree/master/Clustering/Hierarchical%20grouping)
